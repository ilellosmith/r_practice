Assumption,Explanation,Detection,Fix
Independence of Errors,"A violation of this assumption is called psuedoreplication. It occurs when you treat multiple data points from the same unit of analysis as separate (independent) units of analysis. Violations typically arise when there are unintented spatial or temporal groupings in the data. It can also arise if you have not deduped your data. E.g., if you have multiple sets of survey responses from an individual but treat them as independent response sets.","Plot residuals from your model against any temporal or spatial variables. If there are patterns, this assumption is violated. ",Good experimental design is the best way to avoid non-independence of errors. Deduping pre-analysis is also important if you have multiple data points per individual outside of your study design.
Linearity in logit for continuous variables,"Logistic regression is a linear model with a logit link function. Being a linear model, it assumes that continuous independent variables are linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable.",Plot each of the continuous variables against the dependent variable (logit). You can also create a regression term that is the interaction between each continuous variable and its natural logarithm. If one of these terms is significant this assumption is violated.,"If there is substantial nonlinearity, consider transformations, or adding power terms (continuous var to the 2nd or 3rd power). "
Sufficient Sample Size,"How much sample size you need in logistic regression depends on what level of statistical power you want your regression to have, how many variables you have in your regression, whether you have high levels of separation with one or more variables (i.e. all 1s or all 0s of your dependent variable fall into a single category of an independent variable), and how much multicollinearity you have in your system. However, there is always a ""too little"" when it comes to sample size.","Prior to collecting your data, conduct power calculations, univariate analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to help determine what sample size you need to answer your research questions.","If your sample size is too small, your best bet is to collect additional sample. If that's not possible, you will likely need to modify your analysis based on what questions, if any, are answerable using the sample you collected."
Lack of strongly influential outliers  ,"Influential outliers can substantially increase uncertainty in your model, as the model accomodates the outliers at the expense of a good fit to the majority of your data.","Calculate Cook's Distance for each observation. Conceptually, the metric shows how much the fitted values in your model change when a data point is removed. ","Take a closer look at data points with high values for Cook's Distance. You can choose to remove these points (if there was an error in data collection), replace them with aggregate values (e.g. mean or median of dataset), or leave them in your analysis noting that they have a strong impact on your model."
Absence of substantial multicollinearity among independent variables,Having two or more highly correlated variables in your regression will reduce the efficiency of your estimates.,Use exploratory plots (such as correlation plots) to identify high degrees of multicollinearity. High varience inflation factors in your model output also indicate multicollinearity.,"Whether multicollinearity is a major challenge for your model depends on the degree of correlation between your variables. If the correlations are substantial, removing one or more of the most correlated variables is a good place to start. Methods such as Principal Component Analysis can help you decide which variables are useful to retain."
